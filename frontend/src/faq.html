            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q1. Who can donate food?</span><br>
                👉 Registered canteens, hostels, mess, restaurants, event organizers, or individuals with surplus food.
            </p>

            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q2. What kind of food can be donated?</span><br>
                👉 Freshly cooked, hygienic food following FSSAI guidelines. No expired, spoiled, or half-eaten food.
            </p>

            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q3. How do we ensure food safety?</span><br>
                👉 Donors declare preparation time and packaging condition. The system tags food as “Safe to Eat for X
                Hours”.</p>

            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q4. Why can’t students order too much food?</span><br>
                👉 To ensure fair distribution and avoid misuse, each student has a daily limit on the number of meals
                they can claim.</p>

            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q5. Why do NGOs get higher priority?</span><br>
                👉 NGOs serve vulnerable groups and communities; hence they are given bulk order rights and higher
                priority in receiving surplus food.</p>

            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q6. How is pickup/delivery managed?</span><br>
                👉 Pickup slots are scheduled via the app. Delivery is managed by volunteers, logistics teams, or NGO
                staff.</p>

            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q7. What happens if donated food isn’t claimed?</span><br>
                👉 Unclaimed food is diverted to compost/biogas plants, ensuring zero waste.</p>

            <p><span class="font-semibold">Q8. How does the platform track impact?</span><br>
                👉 The dashboard shows meals served, food saved, and carbon/water footprint avoided.</p>
